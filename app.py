(LLMs), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Knowledge Graph Embeddings to transform chatbot 
development. This platform enables users to select from pre-trained LLMs, define chatbot behavior, and 
integrate domain-specific knowledge bases, streamlining chatbot creation for developers and businesses. 
The platform functions by first selecting a pre-trained LLM, which is then fine-tuned using descriptive 
prompts to define the chatbot's behavior. The fine-tuned model is then integrated with a knowledge graph, 
powered by FAISS and Hugging Face embeddings, to provide accurate and context-aware responses. Upon 
receiving user input, the platform retrieves relevant information from the knowledge graph and generates 
a response using the LLM, presenting it to the user through a Streamlit-powered interactive UI.

captions for images on social media platforms. Leveraging computer vision and natural language processing, 
I integrated multimodal model components to enable seamless interaction between image and text data. 
This project showcased my expertise in deep learning, multimodal model integration, and AI-driven content 
generation, highlighting my ability to work with cutting-edge technologies and deploy sophisticated machine 
learning models for practical applications. """,
        "Autonomous AI Agents for Game Development": """Developed an innovative project using the CrewAI framework, where I orchestrated a crew of AI agents to 
autonomously create basic Python games. The AI agents were designed with specific roles and goals, such 
as game design, coding, and debugging, to collaboratively build fully functional games. Each agent was 
equipped with memory and custom tools to enhance its capabilities, ensuring efficient task execution and 
seamless interaction. The project demonstrated the potential of multi-agent systems in automating complex 
development tasks and showcased the practical application of AI in software engineering. """,
        "Interactive PDF Analysis": """I built a Streamlit web application that empowers users to analyze PDFs interactively using cutting- edge NLP 
techniques. Users upload PDFs which are processed with Transformers to create a searchable knowledge base. 
The application's core functionality is a chat-like interface powered by OpenAI's GPT-3 Large Language Model 
(LLM). This allows users to ask questions and receive real-time, informative answers directly related to the 
uploaded PDF content. This project showcases my active development skills using Streamlit, implementation 
of advanced NLP techniques (RAG and Transformers), and utilization of powerful AI models (GPT-3) to create 
user-centric applications.
